      <h2 class="ba">Resturant Description</h2>
      <p class="ba">This classic German pub was founded by St. John on his mission trip to America in 1901.  While the building has been updated for structural reasons all the decore is imported for Germany and has been collected through the years as the St. John's family establishment has been passed down throught the generations.  Here you will experience the way bratwurst originally tasted with a recipe that has withstood the test of time.  You may also want to try recipes that have developed over the years and thats okay, we have you covered.  If bratwurst isn't your thing (why'd you come, just kidding) we have you covered with plenty of other classic German dishes, and substitutes to fit all diets.  Oh and don't forget there is BEER, classic German beers, we also carry the locals if that's what you prefer.</p>
